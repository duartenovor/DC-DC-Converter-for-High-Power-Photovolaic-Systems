# DC-DC Coverter for High Power Photovoltaic Stations

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Worldwide there is a huge dependence on fossil fuels to produce electricity.
The result of burning fossil fuels results in C02 emission into the atmosphere,
causing a huge negative environmental impact. Among other reasons, the focus on
renewable energies has intensified, particularly in photovoltaic solar energy,
as a source of of electricity to mitigate the problems inherent to the use of
fossil fuels. Power electronics converter solutions for solar photovoltaic
panels interface are vast and have advantages and disadvantages depending on
the purpose. In addiction, when the purpose is efficiency it is important to
consider the choice of the most appropriate power semiconductors. <br\>
This project consists of a study, implementation, and development of a DC-DC
power electronics converter for high-power photovoltaic solar applications.
In this study, a DC-DC boost interleaved converter controlled by an
incremental inductance MPPT algorithm combined with a proportional integral
controller for individual control of the current on each arm was applied to
extract the maximum power available for different radiation and temperature
conditions.
